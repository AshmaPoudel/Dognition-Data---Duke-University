# Dognition-Data---Duke-University
Analyzed the Duke University Dognition dataset to study how inter-test intervals impact test completion. Cleaned outliers (>175 tests), aggregated data by DogID, and ran regression analysis. Found statistical significance but very low explanatory power, showing timing alone is a weak predictor of engagement.
